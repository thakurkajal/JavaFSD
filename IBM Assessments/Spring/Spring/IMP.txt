Note : PlatformTransactionManager implementations are defined like any other object (or bean) in the Spring Framework IoC container. 


Note: 

    Singleton : It returns a single bean instance per Spring IoC container.This single instance is stored in a cache of such singleton beans, and all subsequent requests and references for that named bean return the cached object.If no bean scope is specified in bean configuration file, default to singleton.

    Prototype : It returns a new bean instance each time when requested. It does not store any cache version like singleton.

    Request : It returns a single bean instance per HTTP request.

    Session : It returns a single bean instance per HTTP session (User level session).

    GlobalSession : It returns a single bean instance per global HTTP session. It is only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext (Application level session).
